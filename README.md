This is an R project on a **"Study of Personal Level Screening for COPD and COPD Patient Management Survey"**. This project needs a lot of data cleaning, especially related to the **Multiple response set** and their analysis.

Some codes applied in **tbl_summary()** give the **test-statistic value ** and both **row and column variable names** of _Chi-square association tests_.
